grandfather Thats why I felt at ease taking care of him Did you have a hard time taking care of him Not really but its the loneliness that will get you There arent many Filipinos there Plus Seor Luigis vineyard was in a provincial area Oh Last year his closest friends visited him Monica was with them But after a few days Seor Luigi passed away Monica was the one who helped me She really surprised me She didnt mind doing the work Washing the dishes Serving the funeral guests Really Miss Monica did Yeah Really She doesnt seem to be the type Hey shes not like that Thank you I think youre talking about a different girlfriend Tonio You just dont know Monica like I do So why did Miss Monica tell me that she met you on a cruise ship Maybe because thats where we bonded When Seor Luigi died he left me a lot of money And he left strict instructions for me to go on vacation So when Monica told me she was going on a cruise I went with her Thats where you got to know all of Monica Meaning thats where you meddled with Monicas mufflers Mama Mae so so what Im just worried about you I just dont want you getting hurt by Tonios answer because you know Mama Mae whatever Tonio says

You know I think you just need to show your work to Miss Monica Im sure shell be impressed Why not bring her to your province Oh Why are you still up Im just editing a video presentation for a client Mmm Uh by the way who drove you home My new client He looks like Like Tonio Mmmm That was Tonio Mommy Hes your client My God Steph Hes nothing but trouble You need to get away from him while you can Unbelievable Go to the province with you What Why Ill introduce you to my family Ill also show you my woodwork I want to prove to you that setting up a furniture shop wont be a waste of money I just cant see myself running a highend bar Is this because I missed dinner last night So youre backing out Is that it Monica Im not interested in setting up a bar Then study up on it Why do you keep insisting on this furniture thing Monica youre my girlfriend but you dont seem to have faith in me Unlike Steph who has complete faith in me Ants sorry I have faith in you Okay Im gonna reconsider that furniture thing But I cant go to the province with you Maybe next time okay Move my meeting with Mr Reyes to pm and tell him Im on my way okay Yes maam Miss Monica Yes Can I ask you something Okay Make it fast because Im busy What I saw your car outside the restaurant last night Why didnt you come in Follow me Actually I kind of feel guilty about it I just wish life was less complicated When I met him in Italy I was still heartbroken over Andrew So when Anton told me he wanted to come with me on the cruise I was okay with it Normally I wouldnt have allowed it because I barely knew him But you know he made me laugh He made me feel beautiful and special Have you ever felt that way Steph His rural attitude His corny humor Even his bad grammar All of that was so wonderful That was back then When we were still in paradise But not now when were back in the real world Its just better to introduce him to family and friends as a fellow passenger that I met on a cruise ship Theres no way that I would tell them Im in a relationship with a seaman Turned caregiver Its embarrassing He had an honorable job Steph dont be so naive After all were in the world of PR And thats not the point This is the first guy who is willing to do anything for me who is willing to change for me Thats why I really want this relationship to work But you confronting me like this and planting seeds of hope in his furniture shop Miss Monica if you could just give Anton a chance I did I told him I would reconsider But only after Ive been proven wrong That its not going to be a waste of money Catch my drift Steph I think this is going beyond what Miss Monica is asking of you This is girlfriendlevel effort for a guy you claim to be just a friend Steph Im just concerned for you This might be another MU for you A MisUnderstanding with Major Uncertainty Come on Lets grab some lunch Okay I might lose some weight Oh gosh Im super excited Im ready for the beach See Look at me I put on sunscreen Oh Show a little excitement I cant believe you Finally you get to introduce me to your family Mmmm Tep Youre in uniform What are you doing here Do we have a session No but I heard MTV cant go with you to the province to see your furniture Yeah Im kind of bummed out about it Mmm No no no Youre not allowed to mope Im here because Im going to make sure that MTV will still see your furniture So instead of

Stephanie You almost quit school before Now youve quit your job Youre going to destroy yourself again over that man Youre letting him make a fool of you again Who else will suffer this time Havent you learned your lesson He already left you once He wouldnt have done so if you didnt talk to him If you didnt scare him into thinking that he would ruin my life But dont worry I wont let myself get fooled again I wont let myself get destroyed again I will not love Tonio again even if thats how I really feel I will do that Not because I think its wrong or because I might get hurt again I will do it Its because I dont want to give you more reason not to love me I dont want another seven years to go by That whenever you look at me all you see are my mistakes Here Tonio This will calm you Tonio Are you okay Are you feeling ill Maybe you shouldnt go to Monicas party Mama Mae I have to Monica is expecting me And Ive been waiting a long time for this So why dont you look too happy You look like youd rather go somewhere else Mama Mae Monica is my girlfriend I should be with her Its why I changed for her As the saying goes Change is good as long as you change for the better Thats in English This is whats right This is what should be You know I admire your determination to stay with Monica But if youre sticking to that You might be stopping yourself from experiencing the joy of true love Keep in mind Tonio determination is not the same as love Hi babe You look great Mmm Stand up straight How are you Um are you ready I want to introduce you to my friends Come on Anton Monica told me you plan to open a bar Have you picked out a location Were still looking for a place where we Actually Anton is still doing his research We already know that theres a lot of bars that are open right now So we wanna make sure that his stands out You know Anton he loves to take calculated risks Come on Anton I know you worked abroad So Im sure you know about taking risks Yeah In fact Ive been to many countries I started working as a Actually Anton has worked in so many places When I met him he was working for a big wine ranch in Italy And I thought he was done with it But you know once a businessman always a businessman Actually Im not sure if Im a good businessman at all But youre right But why Im used to taking risks Thats what I did when I jumped off a ship to become an illegal immigrant Oh he was a seaman before Thats interesting It was hard but a lot of people helped me Thats why I have so much respect for wealthy people like you So when I got rich I told myself that I should never feel ashamed about where my money came from Because that was a blessing to me a blessing given to me by a kind person who accepted me for who I was Youre really lucky then Thank you for the wonderful evening Please excuse me I have to go Uh excuse me Ill be back I think theyre having a fight Okay Anton Anton What was that all about You humiliated me in front of my guests I just defended myself Because I felt so small I didnt embarrass you Monica You embarrassed me I was just protecting you from them Protecting me Why Because theyre judgmental They didnt even mind my bad English and my being unsophisticated But you did Monica You think they werent judging you They were just being nice to you but they were already judging you in their minds But youre judging me to my face You couldnt even let me speak for myself Because youre afraid everything I say will embarrass you Oh my god Why are you being so juvenile about this Is this about Stephanie again Steph has nothing to do with this Well ever since you started working with her youve changed Isnt that what you want That I change for you You make it sound like change is such an awful thing Anton Tonio My name is Tonio This isnt easy for me Tonio This isnt easy for me either Monica To admit that Im not enough that Im so flawed in your eyes The pain I feel right now is the same as when my mother left me the same pain I felt when I had to leave Steph because I felt that I wasnt good enough for her Because I love you I let you change who I was thinking that once Im finally a good fit for you you might love me wholeheartedly But now I realize that will never happen We will never be a good fit for each other No matter how much I study English no matter how hard I try to fit in with your friends and no matter what clothes I wear Im still nothing but trash to you Im so tired Monica Are you saying that its over Im sorry Daddy Steph come here Steph its okay Its okay to get tired to get hurt Its even okay to make mistakes But you also have to forgive yourself Daddy Daddy Im so sorry Im so sorry for what happened to you Steph I never blamed you nor does your mom So stop thinking like that She just doesnt want you to get hurt again She knows that even though I got paralyzed youre the one with the deeper wound She just doesnt know how to help you But Daddy She still resents me for what happened
